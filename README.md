### Hi there! OlÃ¡! Ciao! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Arthur Paulucci Carnieto, nice to meet you!

I'm a tech nerd in the heart and I love to learn new languages (computer ones and human ones as well!) and new cultures. I love to build new connections, get to know new people and discuss codes and technologies. If there is one thing I've learned in the past few years is that it is simply impossible to master everything, that's why it's so important to me to value everyone around me and give and ask for help.

Learning is not always a smooth ride, in fact it is mostly rough, full of obstacles and stressful! That's why it is important to have inner peace and take care of mental health and productivity.

If you are curious about anything, being it code or not, please feel free to get in contact with me! I'm very approachable and friendly.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a CakePHP project. (It's in a private repository, you can DM me to ask to see it. There are high chances I'll change it to a public repo in the future!)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rails framework and Italian.
- ðŸ“« Get to know me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-carnieto/). My favorite way of professional communication, please feel free to check my profile, connect with me or send me a message!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... anything, really!
